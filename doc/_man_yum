        To list all updates that are security relevant, and get a return code on whether there are security updates use:

              yum --security check-update

       To upgrade packages that have security errata (upgrades to the latest available package) use:

              yum --security update

       To upgrade packages that have security errata (upgrades to the last security errata package) use:

              yum --security update-minimal

       To get a list of all BZs that are fixed for packages you have installed use:

              yum updateinfo list bugzillas

       To get a list of all security advisories, including the ones you have already installed use:

              yum updateinfo list all security

       To get the information on advisory FEDORA-2707-4567 use:

              yum updateinfo info FEDORA-2707-4567
      
       For  Red  Hat  advisories,  respin suffixes are also accepted in the ID, although they won't have any effect on the actual
       respin selected by yum, as it will always select the latest one available.  For example, if you use:

              yum updateinfo info RHSA-2016:1234-2

       while RHSA-2016:1234-3 has been shipped already, yum will select the latter (provided  your  updateinfo.xml  is  current).
       The  same  would happen if you just specified RHSA-2016:1234.  That said, there's no need for you to specify or care about
       the suffix at all.
